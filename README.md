# Violin: Intstrumenting JavaScript

### Demo: http://latentflip.github.com/violin

This is a very early stage project looking at instrumenting and visualizing JavaScript execution.

What's here so far was thrown together in a few hours, so apologies that it's all a bit of a mess.

Got ideas, just holler.
